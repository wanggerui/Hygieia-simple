GnuPG Signing.
==============

A digital signature certifies and timestamps a document. If the document is subsequently modified in any 
way, a verification of the signature will fail. A digital signature can serve the same purpose as a 
hand-written signature with the additional benefit of being tamper-resistant.

So we'll need to create a public/private keypair for every person who is responsible for generating a release
to maven central so that we can say "yes, this person released these artifacts." We'll go over below, how
to set up your public-private GPG keypair such that you can sign releases or anything for that matter.

### Installing GnuPG

By GPG, we refer to [Gnu Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/), which is an open implementation
to the OpenPGP standard as defined by [RFC4880](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt). For our purposes
we assume that the user is on a Mac and can run `brew install gpg`. But, if one needs to do something manual
one needs to install both __Pinentry__ as well as __GnuPG__ from  https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html.

Install __pinentry mac__ via `brew install pinentry-mac`. 


#### Generating gpg keyfiles for signing.

We recommend that you follow the [github instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
for creating a new GPG key. Furthermore, we suggest that you use `RSA and RSA` with a keysize of `4096`, and
an expiration date `4y` in the future. Use your real name, your Capital One email address, and no comment.
You will be asked to use a *passphrase*. Clearly, we recommend a strong passphrase. GnuPG will then ask 
you to generate entropy.

#### Logging into your key.

We'll need to get our passphrase that we used above set up with pinentry, and thus we proceed with the following
commands:

```bash
$ echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
$ killall gpg-agent
```

which will set up your gpg-agent to rely upon pinentry for retrieving the password. Finally you'll run:

```bash
$ echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```

which will cause pinentry to ask you for your passphrase. We suggest that you store your passphrase in your
keychain. Though note, doing this will no longer require that you enter your passphrase to sign things from
your command line which is a mild security risk. You can, on the other hand, enter your passphrase manually 
every time.

### Setting up github for gpg signing commits and maven builds.

You can list your gpg keys in the following way:

```bash
$gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2023-04-21
/Users/abcdefg/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
--------------------------------
sec   rsa4096/C512F178A71B4D90 2019-04-22 [SC] [expires: 2023-04-21]
      894ECF5B95DCE4636385EA20C512F178A71B4D90
uid                 [ultimate] My Name <my.name@somedomain.com>
ssb   rsa4096/9D4AEA4F32FFCF70 2019-04-22 [E] [expires: 2023-04-21]
```

which gives you the label of your private GPG signing key. To set git up to handle signing your commits
you'll have to set your gitconfig in the following way:

```bash
$ git config --global user.signingkey C512F178A71B4D90
```

From here you should be able to run:

```bash
git commit -S -a -m "My commit message"
```

for commits and:

```bash
git tag -s <my_tag_name> -m "My tag message"
```

for tags, each of which will add a signature to your commit or tag respectively. Note, you will not get credit in github until you put your gpg public
key into `Settings>SSH and GPG Keys>GPG Keys>New GPG Key.`

### Adding your public key to github.

Run the following to print your public key from the command line:

```bash
gpg --armor --export my.name@somedomain.com > ~/Desktop/mykey.asc && cat ~/Desktop/mykey.asc
```

This will print something that looks like:

```

which is what you will put in github or a `KEYS` file associated with a project.

### Adding your public key to a keyserver.

You need to add your public key to an external keyserver (all of which get mirrored around the world),
before Maven Central will "accept" your signature. To do this, navigate to http://keys.gnupg.net/,
 select "Submit Key," and copy the same block of text that you added to github from the [Adding your 
 public key to github](#adding-your-public-key-to-github) section. You should then be able to sufficiently
 close staging repositories in http://oss.sonatype.org.
